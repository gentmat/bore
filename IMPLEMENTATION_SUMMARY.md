# Bore GUI Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Sign Up Functionality ✅

**Frontend (bore-gui):**
- Created `SignUpPage.tsx` component with form for name, email, password, and confirm password
- Updated `LoginPage.tsx` to include "Sign Up" link
- Updated `App.tsx` to handle both login and signup flows with state management
- No email verification required - accounts activate immediately

**Backend (Rust - commands.rs):**
- Added `signup` command that calls backend API `/api/auth/signup`
- Automatically saves credentials and logs user in after successful signup
- Registered new command in `main.rs`

**Backend (Node.js - server.js):**
- Existing `/api/auth/signup` endpoint already supported
- Returns `user_id` and `token` on successful signup
- Auto-activates accounts without email verification

### 2. Code-Server Auto-Installation ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added `check_code_server_installed()` command - checks if code-server is available
- Added `install_code_server()` command - downloads and installs code-server from official script
- Uses `curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh` installation method
- Checks run automatically when user logs in (only installs if not found)

### 3. Bore Client Detection ✅

**Implementation:**
- Detects bore client installation (tries `bore-client` then `bore` commands)
- Works with both global cargo installations and local builds
- Returns helpful error message if bore client not found
- Automatically determines which command name to use

### 4. Port Management & Auto-Start ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added `find_available_port_command()` - finds first available port starting from 8081
- Uses TCP socket binding to check port availability
- Automatically increments port number until free port found
- Integrated into instance creation workflow

**Auto-Start Flow:**
1. Find available port (starting from 8081)
2. Start bore tunnel: `bore <port> --to 127.0.0.1`
3. Start code-server: `code-server --bind-addr 127.0.0.1:<port>`
4. Both services use the same port (code-server on localhost, bore forwards it)

### 5. Instance Creation Workflow ✅

**New Workflow:**
- On first login, automatically checks for code-server and installs if needed
- Creates first instance automatically if user has no instances
- User can only edit the instance name (all other settings auto-configured)
- Instance is created and started in one operation
- Backend API stores instance metadata

**Updated Components:**
- `CreateInstanceModal.tsx` - simplified to only allow name editing
- Shows info banner about auto-configuration
- Automatically finds port and starts services

### 6. Backend API Updates ✅

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/instances` - List all instances for authenticated user
- `GET /api/instances/:id` - Get single instance details
- `POST /api/instances` - Create new instance
- `DELETE /api/instances/:id` - Delete instance

**Instance Schema:**
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  user_id: string,
  name: string,
  localPort: number,
  local_port: number,  // snake_case support
  region: string,
  serverAddress: string,
  status: string,
  publicUrl: string | null,
  public_url: string | null  // snake_case support
}
```

### 7. Dashboard Auto-Start Logic ✅

**Implementation:**
- On dashboard mount, runs `initializeCodeServer()`
- Checks if user has existing instances
- Only creates new instance if user has zero instances
- Shows loading indicator during initialization
- User can manually create additional instances via "New Instance" button

## Files Modified

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
- `/bore-gui/src/App.tsx` - Added signup flow
- `/bore-gui/src/components/LoginPage.tsx` - Added signup link
- `/bore-gui/src/components/SignUpPage.tsx` - **NEW** - Signup form
- `/bore-gui/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Auto-initialization logic
- `/bore-gui/src/components/CreateInstanceModal.tsx` - Simplified to name-only

### Backend (Rust)
- `/bore-gui/src-tauri/src/commands.rs` - Added 5 new commands
- `/bore-gui/src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Registered new commands

### Backend (Node.js)
- `/backend/server.js` - Added new instance management endpoints

## Usage Flow

### For New Users:
1. User opens bore-gui
2. Clicks "Sign Up" 
3. Enters name, email, password
4. Account created and auto-activated
5. Redirected to dashboard
6. Code-server auto-installs (if needed)
7. First instance auto-created with available port
8. Bore tunnel and code-server auto-start
9. Instance visible in dashboard

### For Existing Users:
1. User opens bore-gui
2. Logs in with email/password
3. Dashboard loads existing instances
4. User can create additional instances manually
5. Each new instance auto-configures port and starts services

### Web Portal Integration:
- When user logs into website with same credentials
- They see the same running instances
- Instance list synced via backend API
- No "Connect" button needed - instances shown if running

## Technical Notes

### Port Selection:
- Starts checking from port 8081
- Increments until available port found
- Same port used for both code-server and bore tunnel
- Code-server binds to 127.0.0.1:<port>
- Bore forwards that port to the tunnel server

### Bore Server:
- Currently hardcoded to connect to `127.0.0.1:7835`
- Can be changed later to use custom bore server
- Uses user's token as tunnel secret

### Process Management:
- Code-server spawned as child process
- Bore tunnel runs in tokio task
- Handles stored in app state for cleanup
- Stopped when user logs out or closes app

## Known Limitations

1. **Bore client must be pre-installed** - The GUI doesn't auto-install bore client yet
2. **Process cleanup** - May need better process management on app restart
3. **Port conflicts** - If code-server crashes but port still bound, need manual cleanup
4. **Error handling** - Some edge cases may need more graceful error messages

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. Add bore client auto-installation
2. Add process health monitoring
3. Add manual port selection option (advanced users)
4. Add logs viewer in GUI
5. Add bore server selection (allow custom servers)
6. Add instance templates/presets
7. Add resource usage monitoring
