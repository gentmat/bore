# Implementation Summary: Managed Tunnels

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the managed tunnel system.

## What Changed

### Client Architecture

The bore client now supports two modes:

1. **Managed Mode (NEW)**: Users authenticate via web dashboard and CLI
2. **Legacy Mode**: Direct tunnel with `--to` and `--secret` (still works)

### New CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bore login` | Authenticate with email/password |
| `bore logout` | Remove stored credentials |
| `bore list` | List all tunnel instances |
| `bore start <name>` | Start a tunnel by instance name/ID |
| `bore stop` | Stop tunnel (placeholder) |

### New Files Created

#### Client Code
- `bore-client/src/auth.rs` - Credential management
- `bore-client/src/api_client.rs` - Backend API communication

#### Documentation
- `NEW_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture design
- `BACKEND_API_SPEC.md` - API specification for backend implementation
- `USER_GUIDE_MANAGED.md` - User guide for managed tunnels
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files
- `bore-client/src/main.rs` - Added new commands and handlers
- `bore-client/src/client.rs` - Hide public URL in managed mode
- `bore-client/Cargo.toml` - Added dependencies
- `README.md` - Updated documentation links and quick start

---

## User Experience Changes

### Before (Legacy)
```bash
$ bore 8080 --to tunnel.example.com --secret sk_live_abc123

✓ Tunnel established!
  Public URL: tunnel.example.com:15234
  Forwarding to: localhost:8080
```

**Problems:**
- User must remember server address
- User must copy/paste API key
- Public URL shown in CLI (security concern per user request)
- Hard to manage multiple tunnels

### After (Managed)
```bash
$ bore login
Email: user@example.com
Password: 
✓ Successfully logged in!

$ bore start my-web-server
✓ Connected to "my-web-server"
✓ Forwarding localhost:8080

# Public URL visible only in web dashboard
```

**Benefits:**
- No server address to remember
- Login once, use everywhere
- Public URL managed in dashboard (per user request)
- Easy to manage multiple instances
- Better for teams and production use

---

## What Works Now

✅ **Client Implementation**
- Login command with email/password
- Logout command
- List instances command
- Start instance command
- Credential storage in `~/.bore/credentials.json`
- Secure file permissions (Unix)
- API client for backend communication
- Backwards compatibility with legacy mode

✅ **Documentation**
- Architecture design document
- Backend API specification
- User guide
- Updated README

✅ **Build**
- Compiles successfully
- All dependencies resolved

---

## What's Needed: Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Tables

```sql
-- User instances/tunnel configurations
CREATE TABLE instances (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  local_port INT NOT NULL,
  server_region VARCHAR(100),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'inactive',
  public_url VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, name)
);

-- Temporary tunnel tokens
CREATE TABLE tunnel_tokens (
  token VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  instance_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  server_host VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  remote_port INT NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. API Endpoints

**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login

**Instance Management:**
- `GET /api/user/instances` - List user's instances
- `POST /api/user/instances/{id}/connect` - Get connection info

**Bore Server Integration:**
- `POST /api/internal/validate-key` - Validate tunnel tokens (UPDATE EXISTING)

See `BACKEND_API_SPEC.md` for complete specifications.

### 3. Web Dashboard

**Features needed:**
- User registration/login
- View instances list
- Create new instance (name, local_port, region)
- Edit instance
- Delete instance
- View active tunnel status
- Display public URLs for active tunnels

---

## Testing the Client

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Build the client
cd /home/maroun/Documents/bore
cargo build --release -p bore-client
```

### Test Login (requires backend)
```bash
bore login --api-endpoint http://localhost:4000
# Should prompt for email/password
# Should save credentials to ~/.bore/credentials.json
```

### Test List (requires backend)
```bash
bore list
# Should show user's instances
```

### Test Start (requires backend)
```bash
bore start my-instance
# Should connect to instance and start tunnel
```

### Test Legacy Mode (works now)
```bash
bore 8080 --to 127.0.0.1 --secret sk_test_local
# Should work as before (backwards compatible)
```

## Next Steps

### For Backend Developers

1. **Week 1: Core API**
   - Implement login endpoint
   - Implement list instances endpoint
   - Update validate-key endpoint for tunnel tokens

2. **Week 2: Instance Management**
   - Implement connect endpoint
   - Add port allocation logic
   - Add token generation and cleanup

3. **Week 3: Web Dashboard**
   - User authentication UI
   - Instance management UI
   - Status display

4. **Week 4: Testing & Polish**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting
   - Documentation

### For QA/Testing

Test cases:
- [ ] User can register and login
- [ ] User can create instances in dashboard
- [ ] CLI login stores credentials
- [ ] CLI list shows instances
- [ ] CLI start connects successfully
- [ ] Public URL not shown in CLI
- [ ] Public URL visible in dashboard
- [ ] Multiple tunnels can run simultaneously
- [ ] Legacy mode still works
- [ ] Expired tokens are rejected
- [ ] Wrong credentials are rejected

## Security Considerations

### Client Side
- ✅ Credentials stored with 600 permissions (Unix)
- ✅ Password input hidden (using rpassword)
- ✅ JWT tokens used for authentication
- ✅ HTTPS for API communication (when deployed)

### Backend Side
- ⚠️ TODO: Implement JWT signing/verification
- ⚠️ TODO: Password hashing (bcrypt)
- ⚠️ TODO: Rate limiting on login
- ⚠️ TODO: Tunnel token expiration
- ⚠️ TODO: HTTPS enforcement

---

## Breaking Changes

**None!** This is fully backwards compatible.

Users can still use:
```bash
bore 8080 --to server.com --secret sk_live_key
```

The new managed mode is opt-in.

---

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Will old CLI versions still work?**
A: Yes, the legacy mode is fully supported.

**Q: Can users mix legacy and managed mode?**
A: Yes, they can use `bore login` for some tunnels and `--secret` for others.

**Q: Where are credentials stored?**
A: `~/.bore/credentials.json` with 600 permissions on Unix.

**Q: Can users have multiple accounts?**
A: Currently no, but you can logout and login with different credentials.

**Q: How do teams share instances?**
A: This requires backend support for team/organization features (future work).

## Performance Considerations

- JWT validation is fast
- Tunnel token lookup requires database query (add index on `token`)
- Instance listing requires database query (add index on `user_id`)
- Consider caching for validate-key endpoint (high traffic)

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

Recommended metrics to track:
- Login attempts (success/failure)
- Active tunnel count per user
- Tunnel duration
- Data transferred per tunnel
- Instance creation rate
- Token expiration/renewal rate

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future releases:
- `bore stop` command (graceful shutdown)
- `bore status` command (show current tunnel status)
- `bore logs` command (view tunnel logs)
- Team/organization support
- Custom domains per instance
- Tunnel analytics in CLI
- Auto-reconnect on disconnect
- Config file support (`~/.bore/config.yaml`)
