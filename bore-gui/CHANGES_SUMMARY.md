# Summary of Dependency Auto-Installation Improvements

## Overview

The Bore GUI application now automatically installs `bore-client` and `code-server` dependencies when you first launch it. This eliminates manual setup steps for end users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (Rust) Improvements

**File: `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`**

#### Enhanced Dependency Detection
- `check_bore_client_installed()`: Now checks both PATH and `~/.local/bin` directly
- `check_code_server_installed()`: Checks PATH, `~/.local/bin`, and `/usr/local/bin`

#### Improved Installation Logic
- `install_bore_client()`: 
  - Better error messages with bundled binary path info
  - Verifies installation after copying
  - Provides PATH instructions if verification fails
  
- `install_code_server()`:
  - Uses `--method=standalone` flag for user-level installation (no sudo required)
  - Better error handling with stdout/stderr logging
  - Verifies installation after completion

#### New Helper Functions
- `find_bore_client_binary()`: Locates bore-client in PATH or `~/.local/bin`
- `find_code_server_binary()`: Locates code-server in multiple common locations

#### Enhanced `ensure_dependencies()`
- More verbose logging throughout the process
- Better error messages when installation fails
- Detects if binaries are installed but not in PATH

#### Updated `start_code_server_instance()`
- Uses `find_code_server_binary()` to locate the binary with full path
- Works even if `~/.local/bin` is not in PATH

### 2. Frontend (React) Improvements

**File: `src/App.tsx`**

#### Improved Error UI
- Larger dialog (max-w-2xl) to accommodate more information
- Visual checkmarks (✓/✗) for dependency status
- Better error message formatting with smaller text

#### New Manual Installation Instructions
- Prominent blue info box with installation commands
- Separate instructions for bore-client and code-server
- PATH setup instructions with examples
- Copy-paste ready commands

### 3. Documentation

#### Created `DEPENDENCY_SETUP.md`
- Comprehensive guide for dependency setup
- Automatic vs manual installation explained
- Troubleshooting section with common issues
- Building and development instructions

#### Created `prepare-resources.sh`
- Automated script to build bore-client and prepare resources
- Verification of built binary
- Clear success/error messages
- Made executable with proper permissions

#### Updated `README.md`
- Added Runtime Dependencies section
- Integrated prepare-resources.sh into build instructions
- Enhanced troubleshooting section with dependency-specific fixes
- Added PATH configuration instructions

## Key Features

### Automatic Installation
1. **On First Launch**: App detects missing dependencies
2. **bore-client**: Copies bundled binary to `~/.local/bin/bore-client`
3. **code-server**: Downloads and installs using official script to `~/.local/bin`
4. **User Feedback**: Clear progress messages and error reporting

### Fallback Path Detection
Even if `~/.local/bin` is not in PATH, the app will:
- Check for binaries in `~/.local/bin` directly
- Use full paths when executing binaries
- Provide clear instructions to add `~/.local/bin` to PATH

### Better Error Handling
- Detailed error messages explain exactly what went wrong
- Manual installation instructions shown when auto-install fails
- PATH setup guidance included in the UI

## How It Works

### Installation Flow

```
App Starts
    ↓
Check bore-client
    ├─ In PATH? → ✓ Done
    ├─ In ~/.local/bin? → ✓ Done
    └─ Not found → Install from bundled resources
            ↓
        Copy to ~/.local/bin
            ↓
        Make executable
            ↓
        Verify installation

Check code-server
    ├─ In PATH? → ✓ Done
    ├─ In ~/.local/bin? → ✓ Done
    ├─ In /usr/local/bin? → ✓ Done
    └─ Not found → Download and install
            ↓
        Run official install script (standalone mode)
            ↓
        Verify installation

All dependencies ready → Continue to login
Dependency failed → Show error with instructions
```

### Binary Location Priority

**bore-client:**
1. System PATH (`bore-client` or `bore` command)
2. `~/.local/bin/bore-client`
3. Bundled resources (for installation source)

**code-server:**
1. System PATH (`code-server` command)
2. `~/.local/bin/code-server`
3. `/usr/local/bin/code-server`

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios

1. **Fresh Install (No Dependencies)**
   - Remove both bore-client and code-server
   - Launch app
   - Verify automatic installation
   
2. **Partial Install (Only bore-client)**
   - Keep bore-client, remove code-server
   - Launch app
   - Verify code-server auto-installs

3. **PATH Not Set**
   - Install to ~/.local/bin
   - Remove ~/.local/bin from PATH
   - Launch app
   - Verify app still works using full paths

4. **Build From Source**
   - Run `./prepare-resources.sh`
   - Verify bore-client is in resources
   - Build with `npm run tauri build`
   - Install and test

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if bore-client is installed
which bore-client
ls -la ~/.local/bin/bore-client

# Check if code-server is installed
which code-server
ls -la ~/.local/bin/code-server

# Check PATH
echo $PATH | grep ".local/bin"

# Test bore-client
bore-client --version

# Test code-server
code-server --version
```

## User Experience

### Before These Changes
- User had to manually install bore-client
- User had to manually install code-server
- No clear error messages
- Confusing setup process

### After These Changes
- **Zero manual steps** for most users
- Clear error messages with actionable instructions
- Automatic installation on first run
- Helpful troubleshooting guidance in the UI
- Works even if PATH is not configured correctly

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
1. Add progress bar during installation
2. Allow users to choose installation location
3. Automatic PATH configuration (add to shell rc files)
4. Check for updates to dependencies
5. One-click reinstall button in settings

## Rollout Plan

1. Test on clean Linux systems (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch)
2. Verify bundled bore-client in built packages
3. Test manual installation fallback
4. Update user documentation
5. Release with clear changelog entry
