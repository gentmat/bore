# Dynamic Status Updates - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Previously, tunnel instances would:
- Auto-start but not reflect correct status in UI
- Show "error" status even when working correctly
- Show "Start" button even when tunnel was already connected
- Have port conflicts preventing restart
- Only update status every 5 seconds via polling

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (`src-tauri/src/commands.rs`)

1. **Auto-Start with Real-Time Status**
   - `start_code_server_instance` automatically starts both code-server and tunnel
   - Status immediately updates from "starting" → "active" via events
   - No manual start required - tunnels are instantly available

2. **Real-Time Event Emission**
   - Added `app_handle: AppHandle` parameter to `start_tunnel`, `stop_tunnel`, and `delete_instance`
   - Emits `tunnel-status-changed` events when:
     - Tunnel transitions to "Starting"
     - Tunnel becomes "Active"
     - Tunnel encounters an "Error"
     - Tunnel is "Stopped"
   - Proper state cleanup with explicit `drop()` calls

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Added detailed tracing for tunnel lifecycle events
   - Helps debug status transitions

### Frontend Changes

1. **Event Listener (`src/components/Dashboard.tsx`)**
   ```typescript
   // Listens for real-time tunnel status changes
   listen("tunnel-status-changed", () => {
     loadInstances();
   });
   ```

2. **Optimistic UI Updates**
   - Immediately shows "starting" when Start is clicked
   - Immediately shows "inactive" when Stop is clicked
   - Provides instant visual feedback while backend processes

3. **Visual Enhancements (`src/components/TunnelCard.tsx`)**
   - Added animated pulse effect to "starting" status dot
   - Makes it visually clear when a tunnel is connecting

4. **Updated UI Text (`src/components/CreateInstanceModal.tsx`)**
   - Clarified that both code-server and tunnel auto-start immediately
   - Sets proper user expectations for instant connectivity

## Status Flow

### Create Instance (Auto-Start)
1. User creates instance → Instance created with "starting" status
2. Code-server starts automatically on selected port
3. Tunnel auto-starts in background
4. Backend emits event → UI shows "Starting..." button (disabled, pulsing indicator)
5. Tunnel connects → Backend emits event → UI instantly switches to "Stop" button (green active)
6. If error → Backend emits event → UI shows "Start" button with error message

### Dynamic Button Behavior
- **Active Status** → Shows **"Stop"** button (red, clickable)
- **Starting Status** → Shows **"Starting..."** button (yellow, disabled, pulsing dot)
- **Inactive/Error Status** → Shows **"Start"** button (green, clickable)

### Manual Start (After Stop)
1. User clicks "Start" → UI shows "starting" immediately (optimistic)
2. Backend receives command → Updates state to "Starting", emits event
3. Event received → Frontend refreshes, confirms "starting" state
4. Tunnel connects → Backend updates to "Active", emits event
5. Event received → Frontend refreshes, shows "active" with "Stop" button

### Stop Tunnel
1. User clicks "Stop" → UI shows "inactive" immediately (optimistic)
2. Backend receives command → Aborts task, removes from state, emits event
3. Event received → Frontend refreshes, shows "inactive" with "Start" button

## Benefits

✅ **Auto-Start** - Tunnels connect immediately upon creation, no manual start needed
✅ **Dynamic Buttons** - UI automatically shows "Stop" when connected, "Start" when inactive
✅ **Real-Time Updates** - Status changes reflect instantly via event system
✅ **Instant Feedback** - Optimistic UI updates provide immediate visual response
✅ **No Port Conflicts** - Proper cleanup prevents "address already in use" errors
✅ **Clear Visual States** - Animated pulsing dot shows connection in progress
✅ **Reduced Polling** - Event-driven architecture reduces unnecessary API calls
✅ **Smart Error Handling** - Errors show "Start" button to allow retry

## Testing

Build commands verified:
- Frontend: `npm run build` ✓
- Backend: `cargo check` ✓

To test:
1. Create a new tunnel instance
2. Verify it shows "Starting..." button with pulsing yellow dot
3. Wait for connection - button should automatically change to "Stop" (green/red)
4. Click "Stop" - should immediately show "Start" button
5. Click "Start" again - should work without "invalid socket address" error
6. Verify status changes happen in real-time without manual refresh
