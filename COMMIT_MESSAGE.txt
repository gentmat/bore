## Summary
Fixed multiple GitHub Actions workflows to prevent failures and improve
reliability by updating deprecated actions and adding missing configurations.

- Replaced `actions-rs/cargo@v1` with direct cargo commands
- Modern, actively maintained alternatives

### Action Version Updates (20+ updates)
- actions/checkout: v3 → v4
- actions/setup-node: v3 → v4
