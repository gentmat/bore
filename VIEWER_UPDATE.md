# Tunnel Viewer Update - No More Iframe! ðŸŽ‰

## What Changed?

I've completely removed the iframe-based tunnel viewer and replaced it with a **dedicated full-page viewer**. This eliminates all the authentication and security issues you were experiencing with code-server.

## How It Works Now

### 1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
- Shows all your tunnel instances
- Click the **"View"** button on any active tunnel

### 2. **Dedicated Viewer Page** (`/viewer`)
- Full-page view of your tunnel (no iframe restrictions!)
- Clean header with:
  - **Back to Dashboard** button - returns to your dashboard
  - **Tunnel name and URL** - shows what you're viewing
  - **Reload** button - refresh the tunnel
  - **Open in New Window** button - opens in a separate browser window

### 3. **No More Issues!**
- âœ… Code-server authentication works perfectly
- âœ… No cookie restrictions
- âœ… No cross-origin issues
- âœ… Full browser context for the application
- âœ… Clean, professional UI

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/backend/public/viewer.html` - Dedicated viewer page
- `/backend/public/js/viewer.js` - Viewer page logic

### Modified Files:
- `/backend/public/dashboard.html` - Removed iframe modal
- `/backend/public/js/dashboard.js` - Changed to navigate instead of showing modal
- `/backend/server.js` - Added `/viewer` route

## Try It Now!

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. Log in with: `demo@bore.com` / `demo123`
3. Click **"View"** on the "my-first-tunnel" instance
4. You'll be taken to the full-page viewer
5. Enter your code-server password - it will work perfectly!
6. Click **"Back to Dashboard"** to return

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: Full-page view feels more natural
- **No Restrictions**: Applications work exactly as they would in a normal browser
- **Easy Navigation**: Simple back button to return to dashboard
- **Professional**: Clean, modern interface
- **Flexible**: Can still open in new window if needed

Enjoy your working tunnel viewer! ðŸš€
